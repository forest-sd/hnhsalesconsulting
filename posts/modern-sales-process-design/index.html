    <article class="section"><h2>Designing a Modern Sales Process That Actually Works</h2>
      <p>The traditional sales process — cold call, pitch, demo, proposal, close — is increasingly misaligned with how modern buyers actually make decisions. Today's buyers complete 60-70% of their research before ever engaging with a salesperson. A modern sales process must account for this fundamental shift.</p>
      <p>Start by mapping your buyer's journey, not your selling stages. Understand how your prospects identify problems, research solutions, evaluate options, build business cases, and make final decisions. Your sales process should mirror and support this journey, not fight against it.</p>
      <p>Define clear stage criteria based on buyer behavior, not seller activity. Instead of stages like "demo completed" or "proposal sent," use criteria like "buyer has confirmed the problem is a priority" or "economic buyer is engaged and timeline is established." This ensures your pipeline reflects actual deal progress.</p>
      <p>Build discovery into the foundation of your process. The best modern sellers invest heavily in understanding the buyer's situation before presenting solutions. A rigorous discovery process — exploring the problem, its impact, the decision-making process, and success criteria — creates the foundation for compelling, differentiated proposals.</p>
      <p>Integrate content and digital touchpoints into your process. Equip your sellers with case studies, ROI calculators, competitive comparisons, and educational content that buyers can consume on their own terms. The modern seller is a curator and guide, not a gatekeeper of information.</p>
      <p>Measure and iterate continuously. Track conversion rates between stages, time in stage, and win/loss reasons. Use this data to identify where deals stall or die, and refine your process accordingly. A great sales process is never finished — it evolves with your market and your buyers.</p>
