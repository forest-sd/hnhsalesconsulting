    <article class="section"><h2>Building a High-Performing Sales Team from Scratch</h2>
      <p>Building a sales team that consistently delivers results requires far more than hiring a few experienced reps and setting quotas. It demands a systematic approach to talent acquisition, onboarding, training, management, and culture-building that creates an environment where top performers thrive.</p>
      <p>Start with your ideal rep profile. Define the specific skills, experiences, personality traits, and motivations that correlate with success in your selling environment. This profile should be based on data from your top performers, not assumptions about what a "good salesperson" looks like.</p>
      <p>Structure your interview process to assess both skill and fit. Use role-playing exercises to evaluate selling ability in real-time. Ask candidates to walk you through specific deals they've closed, probing for the strategic thinking and tactical execution that separate top performers from average ones.</p>
      <p>Onboarding is where most companies fail. A comprehensive onboarding program should include product and market training, sales methodology certification, CRM and tools training, ride-alongs with experienced reps, and a structured ramp plan with clear milestones. The typical ramp to full productivity should be 3-6 months, depending on your sales cycle complexity.</p>
      <p>Ongoing development is non-negotiable. Weekly coaching sessions, monthly skill-building workshops, quarterly business reviews, and annual training refreshes keep your team sharp and growing. The best sales organizations invest 5-10% of selling time in development activities.</p>
      <p>Finally, build a culture of accountability and recognition. Clear metrics, transparent reporting, competitive compensation, and regular celebration of wins create the energy and drive that sustain high performance over time.</p>
