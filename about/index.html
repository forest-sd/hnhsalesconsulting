    <section class="section"><h2>About HNH Sales Consulting</h2>
      <p>HNH Sales Consulting was founded on a straightforward premise: businesses succeed when they sell effectively, and effective selling can be taught, systematized, and optimized. Too many companies leave revenue on the table — not because their products aren't good, but because their sales processes aren't aligned with how modern buyers make decisions.</p>
      <p>Our consultants bring real-world sales leadership experience from industries including technology, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, and professional services. We've built sales teams from scratch, turned around underperforming organizations, and helped businesses scale from startup to market leader.</p>
      <p>What sets HNH apart is our commitment to measurable outcomes. We don't deliver binders full of theory — we implement practical systems, coach your team through adoption, and measure results against clear KPIs. Our success is measured by your revenue growth, period.</p></section>
